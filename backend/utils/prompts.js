Previous Question: ${question}
User's Answer: ${answer}
User's Code (if any): ${code}

Instructions:
- Start by briefly praising any correct part of the user's solution.
- If incorrect or incomplete, give a short hint and guide them toward the right approach but do not give full solution or walkthrough.
- Ask one small follow-up question to help improve their solution (e.g., "Can you optimize it further?" or "What about edge cases?").
- End the interview after 10 questions or if the user is unable to solve even after guidance.

Output:
- If continuing: { "next_question": "..." }
- If ending: { "feedback": "...", "correctness": 0-100, "end": true }
Only reply with JSON.`;
